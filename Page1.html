<h2 style=color:00ffff>1.Have A Good Clarity On Your Idea</h2>
<h4 style="color:00ffff" >If you have made up your mind for starting a business, you likely already have a product that you want to sell or at least a market you want for your business. Do thorough market research, know who your competitors are, know what are you good at and offer. You must think of something you can invest in to make your product stand out from your competitors.

Think about why you want to be in that business and something you like and want to do.
What do you need to do to make it more successful?

You can consider opening a franchise. It is an easy option to start a business as it is already recognized. What you need is a good location and funding?

Come up with a name – This is one of the trickiest parts. Your name has to be the best and what defines your business.</h4>
<h2 style="color:00ffff">2.Prepare A Buisness Plan</h2>
<h4 style="color:00ffff">Once you have made up your mind and have clarity on what you want to do. It’s time to think about how you are gonna do it. You will need a business plan to answer that question. It will be like a roadmap for your dream idea coming into real life and growing it.

You must conduct thorough market research, make sure there are a need and demand for your product or services you are offering. You will understand your customers’ need and preferences by doing good market research. Even if you are 100% sure that your business will do wonders, consider an exit plan.</h4>
<h2 style="color:00ffff">3.Evaluate Your Finances</h2>
<h4 style="color:00ffff">After you have good control over what you want to do and how you are gonna do it. It’s now time to think about how you are gonna pay for it. The most common way people pay for their business is by saving money working in a job. You will need to determine if you have enough funds to live on until you make a profit or plan to borrow money. Either way, you need to evaluate how much you need to invest.

Put together an excel sheet and estimate the startup cost for your business, as well as an estimate you will need to keep your business running for about a year.</h4>
<h2 style="color:00ffff">4.Select A Buisness Structure </h2>
<h4 style="color:00ffff" >The next step will be to choose a business structure. You need to select what entity your business is, and It can be a sole proprietary, a corporation or an LLC (Limited Liability Company). You can use an attorney for this or an online service to register your business and determine how to file taxes.</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>5.Build Your Team</h2>
<h4 style="color:00ffff" >Now, this is the right time to start hiring a work team for your business unless you are planning to be your only employee. You must take out the time to decide on different profiles you’ll need in your team to work in every aspect of your business.

If you are not planning to hire permanent employees, you can also outsource your work to freelancers or independent contractors. But don’t forget to take the help of an attorney while making the separate contract agreements.</h4>
