<h2 style=color:00ffff>1.Find Your Products</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>There are 3 ways most online sellers source products: do it yourself (DIY), wholesale, and drop-shipping. Each method has its own benefits and drawbacks. Whatever method you choose, when you think about how to sell a product online, look for products that you feel passionate about and that meet a need in the marketplace.</h4>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>DIY Your Product</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>These are products you make yourself, whether it’s a small-batch baking hobby you’re turning into a business or a 3D print factory in your garage. DIY items are usually the most expensive products to produce, but they can also be the most gratifying if you have a creative urge.

In many cases, you can charge a premium for handcrafted or highly specialized items, just be sure to factor in the time it takes to make the product. Be prepared to reassess your process and strategy if you can’t charge enough to make the business sustainable.</h4>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Wholsale Products</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>The traditional retail model is to buy items in large lots from a manufacturer or wholesaler and sell them individually. You can find wholesale items on sites like Alibaba and Etsy Wholesale. You can also find suppliers by searching for wholesale lots on eBay.

Be sure to check your source carefully. Read reviews, look at Better Business Bureau (BBB) listings, and ask lots of questions before you place your first order. You want to make sure that the products you purchase are of high quality and match the specifications in-person that they claim online.</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>2.Identify Your Niche Market</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>The market is massive for an online seller, but it’s also competitive. The best way to stand out is to find a niche.
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Narrow It Down</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>For instance, if you wanted to sell yoga mats, you’d be up against brands that are already well established in the market. But if you decided to sell yoga mats designed for travel, with hand-painted designs that might increase the cost, you could target a more specific audience—like globetrotting women between the ages of 40 and 55.</h4>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Think About Your Own Niche</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>One way to begin with niche marketing is by thinking about areas where you already have a presence—and perhaps a passion. Maybe your niche market is one that you’re already involved in. Are you a member of any social media groups, message boards, or other online gathering places? Is there a niche where people know you or you have a lot of contacts? If so, that offers a meaningful place to start.</h4>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Make Sure It's Viable</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Whether or not you have a personal relationship with the niche you’re considering, being informed about your market is key. To get to know your niche:
<br>
*Use Google Trends to see what’s popular.<br>
*Join social media groups and online communities related to your market to see what people are talking about.<br>
*Monitor what’s hot on sites like Trend Hunter and Trendwatching.<br>
*Check out your competition and see if you can fill a gap.<br>
*Use the Google Ads Keyword Planner tool to see how big the market is for your niche.<br>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>3.Conduct Market Research</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Once you know who you want to sell to, it’s time to figure out if those people will buy what you plan to offer—and if so, how much they’re willing to pay. This means you must assess the value you can offer in your market. Questions to research about how to sell a product online include:
<br>
*Is the market for your products growing or shrinking?<br>
*How satisfied are people with the existing products in your market?<br>
*What needs aren’t being met?<br>
*What features do people value?<br>
*What is the average price point of your competitors’ products?<br>
*What are your potential customers’ pain points<br>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Price It Right</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>When looking at competitors, don’t make the mistake of assuming that a lower price is automatically better. People are willing to pay a premium price for high-quality products. On the other hand, if your target customers feel that your competitors’ products are overpriced, you could step in to offer them a more economical alternative.

</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>4.Brand Your Buisness</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Your brand identity is built on your logo, website, marketing materials, and other communications with customers. If you make deliberate choices, you can shape your brand identity to be unique and appealing to your customers.

The best way to begin this process is to summarize the qualities you want your brand to convey in just a few words. Is it funky, friendly, and casual? How about sturdy, high-quality, and reliable? Could it be youthful, vibrant, and fun? In the case of a business that sells hand-painted travel yoga mats, the brand might be artistic, unique, and uplifting.</h4>
<h3 style=color:00ffff>Visual Identity</h3>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Every brand has a recognizable, consistent lookthat’s tied together with color, a logo, and your product imagery.

Choose a color palette with one main color and 2 or 3 secondary colors that express your brand identity—for example, red is often perceived as bold, dark blue as luxurious, green as organic. Keep in mind that color associations are often culturally specific, and what appeals to customers in one part of the world may not communicate the same things in another.

Your logo should be simple and expressive. Complicated designs don’t work well when printed in small spaces or if reproduced in black and white. Since your logo will be on everything you create, it should be carefully built to convey your brand’s identity. You can create one yourself using a free online logo creator such as Canva (most will charge you to download your design) or hire a graphic designer.

The images you choose for your website, advertising, and social media should be consistent and express your brand’s image clearly.

For example, the yoga mat brand would market to its 2 personas with imagery in a specific context for each—either a resort class or a hotel room—with a spotlight on the product. That’s a consistent type of image that could quickly become associated with the brand and convey the brand’s identity.</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>5.Build Your E-Commerce Website</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Building an online store has never been easier. And when you build your website in Mailchimp, it can also be free.

Start by creating a website that incorporates the elements of your brand identity. Using Mailchimp’s content studio, you can upload your logo, photos, colors, and other files to incorporate in your website and then use them across marketing channels to stay on-brand.

Make sure your website design makes it easy for shoppers to find your products. Upload images, write specifications, and include details about shipping so that your customers understand exactly what they’re buying (and why they should). Simply add a Stripe buy button to your fresh new website, and you’re ready to start selling.</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>6.Create High-Quality Product Content</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>Ideally, your site would be assembled by experienced copywriters, photographers, and marketing professionals. Realistically, that’s not how most small businesses operate.

If you’re doing it all yourself, here are some tips.</h4>
<h2 style=color:00ffff>Continue To Refine Your Approach</h2>
<h4 style=color:00ffff>All the details that go into how to sell a product online may seem daunting. Besides the product itself, you need a brand identity, a target customer, a web store, and solutions for processing payments and handling shipping—and all of that needs to be in place before you even begin to market your product.

But these steps are manageable if you take them one at a time. Remember that you can continually change and refine your approach as you go.

The important thing is to take your first step, and before you know it, you’ll be riding momentum toward your goals.

An all-in-one Marketing Platform like Mailchimp can help tie together a lot of these elements for you, from brand-building and advertising to customer relationship management.</h4>
